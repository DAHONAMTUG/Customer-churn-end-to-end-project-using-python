The objective of this project to identify the factors that may lead to customer churn, for that i will use python and power BI. and also build a churn prediction model using machine learning.

Bank customer churn is a major challenge for financial institutions. It's a measure of customer loyalty and can happen for reasons like dissatisfaction, high prices, or better alternatives, and it may indicate problems with a company's products, services, or customer experience, leading to a loss of market share, increased acquisition costs, and reduced revenue. 

in the project i will answer:

 1) What are the key drivers of churn in the bank?  Are there particular groups or customer segments that are more  likely to churn?
 
2) How does the length of the customer relationship impact churn?  Are long-term customers less likely to churn than newer customers?
 
3) Is there a relationship between the number of products or services a customer use and their likelihood of churning?

4) How does the customer's interaction with the bank, such asfrequency of calls, impact churn?
 
 in the data science project i will pick try to predict customer churn using machine learning.
 
 all this will be display in Power BI dash board.
 
some of the main insights from the data analysis are : 

1)	Gender: by looking at churn by gender we can see that females were churning at higher rate than males, and the chi-squared test result suggests that there is a statistically significant relationship between gender and attrition. 
The odds ratio of 1.23 indicates that the odds of churning for females are 1.23 times higher compared to males, or in other words, females are 23% more likely to churn compared to males.

2)	Age: Older customers are less likely to churn compared to younger one. There could be many reasons for this relationship. For example,
younger customers may be more likely to switch companies for better dealsor job opportunities, while older customers may be more loyal or have 
fewer options available to them. Additionally, different age groups may  have different preferences or needs when it comes to banking services

3)	Tenure and attrition: The chi-squared test statistic value is 0.61 and the corresponding p-value is 08948. This test result suggests that there is no significant association between the distribution of attrition and tenure, as the p-value is much greater than the commonly used significance level of 0.05. In summary, the test results indicate that there is no significant relationship between attrition and tenure in the given data set.


4)	Gender and tenure: The results of the chi-squared test between gender and tenure suggest that there is no significant relationship between these two variables.

5)	no. of products held: By observing the total no. of products held by the customer there an idication that a rise in th no. of products, the less likelihood there is to churn, this correlation can be observed in various scenarios. And could indicatethe customer loyalty and love for the service the company offers.

6)	Attrition based on number of calles made in the past 12 months:
The results of the Chi squared test indicate that there is a significant association between thedistribution of attrition and the contacts count in the last 12 month.
Looking at the table, it seems that customers who had fewer contacts in the last 12 months (0-3) were more likely to leave the company, while customers who had more
 contacts (4-6) were more likely to be stay. Customers who are more inactive are more likely to be attrited customer To avoid churn, the company should consider taking the following actions:
 

7)	Is customer inactivity a significant predictor of customer attrition:
We can conclude that there is a significant association between attrition status and number of calls made. Looking at the table, we can see that customers who had fewer contacts in the last 12 months (0-3) were more likely to leave the company, while customers who had more contacts (4-6) were more likely to stay. This suggests that the number of calls made is a significant predictor of customer attrition, with customers who have had fewer calls being more likely to leave. . Therefore, customer inactivity should be considered an important factor to monitor and address in order to reduce customer attrition.
